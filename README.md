- AIC is generally preferred when the goal is prediction accuracy. AIC comes from information theory and approximately minimizes expected **KL divergence** from the true model.
- BIC is often preferred when the goal is identifying the true model, especially for large datasets. BIC comes from Bayesian reasoning and approximates the **marginal likelihood**m of the model.
